# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To-Do App:
This is a simple To-Do application built using React. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. The tasks can also be marked as completed or uncompleted. Additionally, users can search for tasks based on their titles.

Features :
Add new tasks with a title.
Update existing tasks.
Delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
Search for tasks based on title.

Usage:
1.When the application starts, you will see an input field to add a new task and a list of existing tasks.
2.Enter a task title in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add a new task to the list.
3.Each task in the list will have buttons to update, delete, and mark it as completed or uncompleted.
4.To update a task, click the "Update" button next to the task. This will open a form where you can modify the task title. Click the "Update Task" button to save the changes or "Cancel" to discard them.
5.To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task. This will remove the task from the list.
6.To mark a task as completed or uncompleted, click the checkbox next to the task title. This will toggle the task's status.
7.To search for tasks based on their titles, enter a search query in the search input field. The list of tasks will dynamically filter and display only the tasks that match the search query.
